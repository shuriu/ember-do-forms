An Ember forms library that handles the icky parts of forms that you don't want to do, but makes no other assumptions otherwise.

Get started with:

  `ember install ember-do-forms`

## Philosophy

My experience with my ambitious application has proven that other (maintained) form builder addons either **do too much**, or are **hard to customize**. So I created `ember-do-forms` because it assumes very little about my form needs.

The basic idea for `ember-do-forms` is simple: assume as little as possible about my HTML and CSS structure, while providing **some** syntactic sugar for the icky parts.

For example, should forms validate my inputs? I'd argue that forms are just UX glue for your data, so forms shouldn't do that. Still I'd like validation UX (CSS, text, etc) to be handled by the form builder because it's a big chunk of boilerplate.

Another icky part is customisation, which most other form builder addons fail short on in varying degrees.

## Features

* [Extremely](#css-customizations) [easy](#component-block-form) to [customize](#component-customizations), thanks to contextual components.
* Bare minimum HTML with no CSS by default. Use it with any CSS framework you like.
* Binds error and success classes (if found) on a field `focusOut` or just before `submit`. Works with [`ember-cp-validations`](https://github.com/offirgolan/ember-cp-validations) by default. [`ember-changeset-validations`](https://github.com/DockYard/ember-changeset-validations) works too with a small configuration tweak.
* Uses [`ember-one-way-controls`](https://github.com/DockYard/ember-one-way-controls) under the hood for controls. But easily extensible with any control type.
* [Fully compatible](#test-selectors) with [`ember-test-selectors`](https://github.com/simplabs/ember-test-selectors).

## Usage

#### Basic usage
```hbs
{{#do-form object submit=(action 'saveTask') as |form|}}

  {{#form.do-field propertyName as |field|}}
    {{field.do-label labelText}}
    {{field.do-control controlType}}
    {{field.do-feedback}}
    {{field.do-hint hintText}}
  {{/form.do-field}}

  {{form.input-field propertyName controlType='email' label='Label' hint='Hint'}}

  <button type='submit'>Save</button>
{{/do-form}}
```
* `do-form` is just a component that wraps components
* `object` is the object the form binds to. It's the only positional param.
* `propertyName` is the property the field binds to on the object.
* `labelText` is the text to display for the label
* `controlType` is the type of control to render. Valid values are `textarea`, `select`, or a valid value for the HTML input `type` attribute. For example `{{field.do-control controlType='checkbox'}}` will render a `<input type="checkbox"` and `{{field.do-control controlType='select'}}` will render a `<select>`.
* `submit` pass in any action you want there. Or not, because it isn't required. Works great with [`ember-concurrency`](https://github.com/machty/ember-concurrency)!
* `{{do-feedback}}` shows the validation error message if it exists. It is bound by default to `field.errorMessage`.
* `{{do-hint}}` shows any hint text you want via the `hintText` parameter.
* use any type of button you want. Use a bare `<button type='Submit'>`, use it with [`ember-async-button`](https://github.com/DockYard/ember-async-button) or do it [with style](http://ember-concurrency.com/#/docs/examples/loading-ui).

#### Input field
You can also use the `{{ember-do-forms/input-field}}` component to combine all of the goodness of the `{{do-field}}` component (and its contextual components) into a single line:

```hbs
{{#do-form object submit=(action 'saveTask') as |form|}}
  {{form.input-field 'lastName' label='Last Name' hint='First name followed by last name'}}

  <button type='submit'>Save</button>
{{/do-form}}
```

If you want to skip labels and hints, just omit the `label` and `hint` arguments.

Also the `classNames` of its rendered sub-components can be modified using `labelClasses`, `controlClasses`, `feedbackClasses` and `hintClasses`.

#### Checkbox field
Same idea as the `{{ember-do-forms/input-field}}` component but providing some syntactic sugar for checkboxes.

```hbs
{{#do-form object as |form|}}
  {{form.checkbox-field 'profileVisible' label='Profile visible' hint='Make your profile visible for the rest of the world?'}}
{{/do-form}}
```

If you want to skip the hint, just omit the `hint` argument. The same `classNames` that can be applied to the `input-field` also apply to the `checkbox-field`.

#### CSS customizations
You can customize the rendered CSS by modifying the default [config](#configuration). But you can also customize classes by individual component.

```hbs
{{#do-form user classNames='my-custom-form-class' as |form|}}

  {{#form.do-field 'fullName' classNames='my-custom-field-class' as |field|}}
    {{field.do-label 'fullName' classNames='my-custom-label-class'}}
    {{field.do-control classNames='my-custom-control-class'}}
    {{field.do-feedback classNames='my-custom-feedback-class'}}
    {{field.do-hint 'First name, followed by last name' classNames='my-custom-hint-class'}}
  {{/form.do-field}}

{{/do-form}}
```

#### Component block form
You can modify the contents of a field easily. Below there is a [Bootstrap 4 custom checkbox](https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/components/forms/#checkboxes) for example. The default `tagName` for a field is `<div>`.
```hbs
{{#do-form user as |form|}}

  {{#form.do-field 'profileVisible' classNames='form-group' as |field|}}
    {{#field.do-label classNames='custom-control custom-checkbox'}}
      {{field.do-control 'checkbox' classNames='custom-control-input'}}
      <span class="custom-control-indicator"></span>
      <span class="custom-control-description">Profile visible?</span>
    {{/field.do-label}}
    {{field.do-hint 'Check this to make your profile visible' classNames='form-text text-muted'}}
  {{/form.do-field}}

{{/do-form}}
```

You can also modify the content of the `{{do-control}}` component. Use whatever you like, the `context` has access to `id`, `value` and `validationClass`, so your custom control will *just workâ„¢*. The default `tagName` is `''`.
```hbs
{{#do-form user as |form|}}

  {{#form.do-field 'customValue' as |field|}}
    {{field.do-label 'Custom Field'}}
    {{#field.do-control as |context|}}
      <input value={{context.value}} id={{context.id}} class="{{context.validationClass}}">
    {{/field.do-control}}
    {{field.do-feedback}}
  {{/form.do-field}}

{{/do-form}}
```

The `{{do-feedback}}` component can be easily customized as well. Just pass a block and it will have access to the error `message`, and displays only if there is one. **The caveat here** is that the component tag name should only be configured via `wrapperTagName`, and the reason is that this component should be hidden unless an error message is present. The default `wrapperTagName` is `<div>`.
```hbs
{{#do-form user as |form|}}

  {{#form.do-field 'firstName' as |field|}}
    {{field.do-label 'First Name'}}
    {{field.do-control 'text'}}
    {{#field.do-feedback wrapperTagName='span' as |message|}}
      {{tooltip-on-component text=message}}
    {{/field.do-feedback}}
  {{/form.do-field}}

{{/do-form}}
```

The `{{do-hint}}` component is very easy to customize. Just pass a block and it will have access to `hintText`. The default `tagName` is `<small>`.
```hbs
{{#do-form user as |form|}}

  {{#form.do-field 'fullName' as |field|}}
    {{field.do-label 'fullName'}}
    {{field.do-control 'text'}}
    {{field.do-feedback}}
    {{#field.do-hint 'First name, followed by last name' as |hintText|}}
      {{tooltip-on-component text=hintText}}
    {{/field.do-hint}}
  {{/form.do-field}}

{{/do-form}}
```

#### Test selectors
If you have added the excellent [`ember-test-selectors`](https://github.com/simplabs/ember-test-selectors) addon to your project you can freely use `data-test-*` to components that have tags and the `ember-test-selectors` will work as advertised. It doesn't work though for components that are wrapper components for other components, which `ember-do-forms` uses in many places (and other form builders use them as well).

You can learn more about why you should use `ember-test-selectors` [by watching this video](https://embermap.com/video/ember-test-selectors).

You can turn on the auto generation of `data-test-*` attributes by changing the default configuration:
```js
module.exports = function(environment) {
  var ENV = {
    'ember-do-forms': {
      autoDataTestSelectors: true
    }
  };
};
```
Now, given you have something like:
```hbs
{{#do-form user as |form|}}
  {{form.input-field 'lastName' label='Last name' hint='What your teacher calls you'}}
{{/do-form}}
```

You can use `testSelector` in your acceptance tests:
* `find(testSelector('do-field', 'lastName'));`
* `find(testSelector('do-label', 'lastName'));`
* `find(testSelector('do-control', 'lastName'));`
* `find(testSelector('do-feedback', 'lastName'));`
* `find(testSelector('do-hint', 'lastName'));`

You can also manually set the attributes:
```hbs
{{field.do-control 'lastName' data-test-do-control='mySpecialSelector' }}
```

The __caveat__ is that the names of the `data-test-*` attributes __must match the component names__ for `do-control`, `do-feedback` and `input-field` components (which are tagless), and __only those attributes are supported__. For components with tags, like `do-form`, `do-field`, `do-label` and `do-hint`, these restrictions don't apply.

#### Component customizations
If you have more complex components for controls for example, rest assured, you can use them. Even some context gets passed in to your custom components!
```hbs
{{#do-form user as |form|}}
  {{#form.do-field 'customValue'
    labelComponent='my-very-smart-i18n-label'
    controlComponent='my-fancy-datepicker'
    feedbackComponent='my-fancy-error-message'
    hintComponent='my-hint' as |field|}}

    <!-- This is will now render 'my-very-smart-i18n-label' -->
    {{field.do-label}}

    <!-- This is will now render 'my-fancy-datepicker' -->
    {{field.do-control}}

    <!-- This is will now render 'my-fancy-error-message' -->
    {{field.do-feedback}}

    <!-- This is will now render 'my-hint' -->
    {{field.do-hint}}
  {{/form.do-field}}
{{/do-form}}
```

## Configuration

The default configuration for `ember-do-forms` is very light.
```js
module.exports = function(environment) {
  var ENV = {
    'ember-do-forms': {
      // The path to be read on the object for an errors array
      errorsPath: 'validations.attrs.{PROPERTY_NAME}.errors',

      // Auto generate relevant data-test-* for components
      // Overridable per component
      autoDataTestSelectors: false,

      // CSS classes to be applied to components
      // Overridable per component
      defaultClasses: {
        form: [],
        field: [],
        label: [],
        control: [],
        feedback: [],
        hint: []
      },

      // CSS classes to be applied to do-field and do-control
      // components based on the validation state of the object
      validationClasses: {
        fieldSuccess: [],
        fieldError: [],
        controlSuccess: [],
        controlError: []
      }
    }
  };
};
```

You can easily extend this configuration. For example Bootstrap 4 classes:
```js
module.exports = function(environment) {
  var ENV = {
    'ember-do-forms': {
      defaultClasses: {
        form: [],
        field: ['form-group'],
        label: ['col-form-label'],
        control: ['form-control'],
        feedback: ['form-control-feedback'],
        hint: ['form-text', 'text-muted'],
      },
      validationClasses: {
        fieldSuccess: ['has-success'],
        fieldError: ['has-danger'],
        controlSuccess: ['form-control-success'],
        controlError: ['form-control-danger']
      }
    }
  };
};
```
